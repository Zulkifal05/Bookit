# 🎫 Book It – Ticket & Hotel Booking Frontend Project

**Book It** is a lightweight, single-page web application (SPA) built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (OOP-based)**. It allows users to **purchase cinema and railway tickets** and **book hotels**—all within a single HTML file. The entire application, including the login system and booking interface, is dynamically rendered using JavaScript. All data is stored in the browser using **Local Storage**, with **no backend required**.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in the browser.
2. A **login form** is displayed, generated dynamically via JavaScript.
3. On successful login , the booking interface is loaded without reloading or navigating.
4. Users can switch between **Cinema**, **Railway**, and **Hotel** booking options.
5. Bookings and user data are stored in the browser’s **localStorage** in JSON format.
6. The app is structured using JavaScript **classes with inheritance** to separate logic for UI, storage, and booking management.
